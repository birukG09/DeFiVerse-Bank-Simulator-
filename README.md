## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project consists of three major components:

1. **Frontend Client**  
   Built with TypeScript and JavaScript, it provides the user interface to interact with wallet balances, staking pools, treasury controls, and live price charts. Styled with CSS for modern, responsive design.

2. **Backend Services**  
   - **Java Module:** Handles REST APIs for user management, authentication, and business logic.  
   - **Rust Module:** Manages heavy computations and real-time price syncing to ensure low latency.

3. **Blockchain Layer**  
   Solidity smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum testnet simulate token minting, burning, staking, loans, and NFT minting, ensuring decentralized trust and transparency.
